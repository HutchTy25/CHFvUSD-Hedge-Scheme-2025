Driven by my passion for travel and currency trends, I dove into the concept of converting USD expenses into stronger currencies like the Swiss franc (CHF) to potentially safeguard long-term buying power in the face of a potentially weakening dollar. 

In this project, I thoroughly:
- Cleaned and standardized monthly rent data sourced from Zillow 
- Retrieved historical USD to CHF exchange rates 
- Developed a dynamic dashboard featuring pivot tables, slicers, and trend projections üìä
- Illustrated rent prices across major U.S. cities in both USD and CHF with forecasted projections.

An interesting find emerged: cities experiencing substantial rent spikes in USD exhibited greater stability when priced in CHF, which is hinting at the potential of currency hedging to stabilize renting/housing expenses in volatile markets.

This project showed my interest and learned skills in Excel modeling, data cleansing, and financial narrative construction, encapsulating the transformative power of global perspectives on local dynamics.

I welcome your insights, particularly from those in the realms of data, finance, or anyone who manages currency risk, cost of living, or financial planning across borders.
